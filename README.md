# pygame-sudoku

The game loads with the classic Sudoku 9 by Nine board. With a **SOLVE** button at the bottom

## HOW IT WORKS
- Click on the cell you want to edit
- Use the arrow keys to adjust the value
- When you've adjusted all values then you click **SOLVE** and the program does the rest
- If the sudoku has no solution it print **INVALID GAME** to the screen after it has tried all possible means.
